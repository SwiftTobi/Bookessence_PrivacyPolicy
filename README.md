Privacy Policy — BookEssence
Last updated: March 23, 2025
This Privacy Policy explains how BookEssence (“we”, “us”, “our”) handles information when you use the BookEssence iOS application (the “App”).
Summary
BookEssence does not collect, track, or sell personal data.
Your notes, quotes, and “Thoughts” are stored locally on your device.
If you choose a background image, the App accesses your photo library only to let you pick an image.
1. Data We Collect
1.1 Content you create
BookEssence lets you create and save:
personal notes
quotes from books
summaries and “Thoughts”
This content is stored only on your device. We do not operate servers that receive or store this content.
1.2 Photos (optional)
If you use the background image feature, the App may request permission to access your photo library so you can select an image.
We do not upload your photos.
Selected images are stored locally on your device within the App’s storage.
You can deny photo access and still use BookEssence.
1.3 Data we do not collect
We do not collect:
name, email address, phone number
account credentials (there is no login)
location data
contacts
advertising identifiers
analytics or usage tracking
crash analytics/diagnostics from third-party SDKs
2. How We Use Data
Because we do not collect personal data, we do not use data for:
advertising
analytics
profiling
selling or sharing with third parties
Photo access (if granted) is used only to provide the background image feature.
3. Sharing of Data
We do not share your personal data with third parties because we do not collect it.
If you choose to export or share content using iOS sharing features (e.g., copy text, share sheet), the recipient app/service will handle that data under its own privacy policy.
4. Data Retention and Deletion
Your content remains on your device until you delete it within the App or uninstall the App. Uninstalling the App removes locally stored App data.
5. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your locally stored data within the App. However, no method of electronic storage is completely secure. You are responsible for securing access to your device (e.g., passcode, Face ID).
6. Children’s Privacy
BookEssence is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
7. Payments (Future)
BookEssence currently does not offer subscriptions or in-app purchases.
If we add in-app purchases or subscriptions in the future (e.g., via Apple StoreKit), payments will be processed by Apple. We do not receive your full payment details (such as credit card numbers). Apple may process purchase-related information under Apple’s privacy policy.
8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version and change the “Last updated” date.
